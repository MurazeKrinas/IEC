# This is just a small project...
I'm doing a scientific research project and here are the codes written by me and my teacher (mostly my teacher 😆). Thanks for visiting! If possible, why don't you try running it 👽 <br/> <br/>
First of all, you have to install pip: sudo apt install python3-pip <br/>
Then, update your pip packages to newest version: pip install pip --upgrade
